## TripPlanner: Build Your Own Backend

![BYOB](http://g.recordit.co/avaxlIqDFr.gif)

#### GitHub: [Repo](https://github.com/devinmarieb/trip-planner)

#### Deployed: [Heroku App ](https://tripplannerprjct.herokuapp.com/)

### Completion

I have eighteen endpoints for TripPlanner:

9 `GET` requests

3 `POST` requests

3 `PATCH` requests

3 `DELETE` requests

I have 53 passing tests for TripPlanner. All endpoints have a test that checks for `status 200` and `status 404`. Where applicable, endpoints are tested for `status 422`.

### JSON: notes after reading the JSON docs (or as much of it as I could actually understand).

`GET /articles HTTP/1.1 Accept: application/vnd.api+json` : This project was my first experience using Postman for actual development / deployment. I'm not sure what do do with headers on the server side, so I did not include anything like this in my code. I do not understand what `self` and `related` links are.

`HTTP/1.1 200 OKContent-Type: application/vnd.api+json` : I guess I'm not sure how exactly how to structure success status codes. Mine are structured `res.status(200)` because it is similar to examples I have seen.

`406 Not Acceptable` : As with above, I did not include any `406 status` codes as I do not quite understand headers.

For all status codes I did not include things like `OK`, `Not Acceptable` and `Not Found`. As mentioned above, my status codes are structures more like `res.status(422).send(error)`.

### [Code I am proud of](https://github.com/devinmarieb/trip-planner/blob/master/server.js#L235-L254)

This is the code for deting a user. I am proud of this code because it was a slightly harder piece of logic to work out. It was the first delete request I wrote and I had to first search trips to make sure that trips associated with the users were deleted before the user was deleted.

### [Code I am not so proud of](https://github.com/devinmarieb/trip-planner/blob/master/server.js#L21-L40)

This is the code for checking if there is a request query. I wouldn't say I'm not proud of this code, but since I didn't know what requests queries were before this project, I'm not sure I went about checking for one the right way. I feel like there is probably a cleaner way to write this piece of code.

### [Sad path test for getting a specific user](https://github.com/devinmarieb/trip-planner/blob/master/tests/server-test.js#L173-L191)

This is an example of a test that checks a sad path.

#### Other notes:

I'm still a little confused about headers. After reading the JSON docs, I'm not sure when/how I'm supposed to declare header types or know when/how I'm supposed to use them.
